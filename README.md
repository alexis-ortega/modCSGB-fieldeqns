# modCSGB-fieldeqns
This is a repository of the mathematica notebooks containing the outputted analytical modified field equations due to Chern-Simons and Guass-Bonnet.

The Notebooks are structured by metrics:
Mod-FLRWMetric.nb corresponding to the modifications in a FLRW metric
Mod-Perturbed Minkowski.nb corresponding to modificiations in a perturbed minkowski metric
Mod-SCmetric.nb corresponding to the schwarzchild metric
Mod-SphericallySymmetric Metric.nb corresponding to the spherically symmetric metric

The mathematica notebooks were complied using a symbolic algebra package by Barak Shoshany. The github can be found here https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRe and the citation as follows "Shoshany, B., (2021). OGRe: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Mathematica. Journal of Open Source Software, 6(65), 3416, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03416"
This package is required to run the notebooks
